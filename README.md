# TheDeadWood-Unity
The Dead Wood is a first person exploration game which I am developing in which a young girl wakes up in the middle of a forest which as had its life seemingly drained from it. Unable to remember how she arrived here she searches the forest for answers, a voice in her head guiding her along the way.
